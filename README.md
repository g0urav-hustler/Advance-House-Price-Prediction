# Advance-House-Price-Prediction
The aim of the project is to predict house prices based on various feature.
## Data Science Project Cycle
##### 1. Data Analysis 
Analzing the data, feature with respect to the target variable by using barplots, histograms and other graphs.
##### 2. Feature Engineering 
Handling missing values and categories of the features, normalizing the data. 
##### 3. Feature Scaling
Scaling the feature variables in limiting values.
##### 4. Model Building
Building your model with different techniques of methods.
#####  5. Model Testing
Testing your model, how accurate it was in predicting the target variable.
